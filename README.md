**What problem does this project solve?**

Breweries are a rich part of American culture, allowing all groups of people to congregate together and have conversations over a relaxing beverage. The popularity of beer in the USA has created an explosion of new breweries in metropolitan areas, and now there are more beer venues than one can really keep track of. How can a beer lover become aware of all the great new breweries around them?

**How Hoppr solves this problem.**

Here is an easy to use app that allows the user to search a radius around their zip code, and returns up to five randomly selected breweries. The included Google Map allows them to spatially understand where the locations are in relation to their zip code geography, and the corresponding results list on the left includes key information such as name, address, and phone number.

**What technologies does this app use?**

The APIs used:

1. Google's Maps API - geolocation and maps services
  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation
2. BreweryDB - brewery information database
  http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs

Technologies used:

1. JavaScript
2. HTML/CSS
3. Bootstrap 3

5. JQuery

**What's next for this project?**

1. Mobile friendly responsiveness
2. Auto-geolocation based on device's cached GPS data
3. Making the map zoom in on area around all brewery marker locations
4. Filter results based on whether it has food or not (brewpubs)
